## ðŸ§  Overview

Conjunctivitis, or "pink eye", presents in various formsâ€”**bacterial**, **viral**, **allergic**, and **normal**â€”each requiring distinct treatment protocols. YOLO-OcuLite provides a robust solution for:
- Real-time detection & classification of conjunctivitis subtypes
- Saliency-aware clinical explainability via OcuMap
- Efficient performance on edge devices with limited compute
